### Things I'm proud of:
- Developing an app tailored for my loved ones, aimed at reducing clothing waste and contributing to a greener planet! üåçüíö
- Got to showcase my CSS and eye for design! 
- Enjoyed learning how to incorporate EJS, a popular template engine for Node.js

### üí° Next steps:
- Currently the app differentiates the users selling by listing their username and teh item being sold. I would create a personalize profile for each user, and allow the post to include their profile name and icon as a differentiator 
- I would create different profile feeds for each user that can be viewed for all the items they're selling, with a section to get reviews from buyers
